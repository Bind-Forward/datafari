capsuleTitle=Capsule configuration
capsuleHelp = The config file is using the txt format. It must be formatted as follows : each line must contain only one capsule declaration, with the following information:
capsuleIntro = Capsules allow you to display information based on search queries. This information will be displayed on top of the search list, in a clearly identified area. With capsules, you can thus display data which are not necessarily part of your index. For instance, assuming you are an HR manager and you want to advertise that there is a summer event at the cantine in June, you can add this information as a capsule whenever an employee searches for "events" for instance.
capsuleTechno = In Datafari v1, capsules work using configuration files that you need to upload to the server. See the related documentation in order to see the file's syntax : <a href="https://datafari.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DATAFARI/Managing+capsules">Documentation </a>
capsuleSelection = Choose the config file to upload to the server :  
capsuleSend = Upload
capsuleDownloadButton = Download
capsuleDownload = Retrieve the current list of capsules on the server 
capsuleSuccess = The config file was succesfully uploaded
capsuleRestart = Please restart Datafari in order to see your new capsules

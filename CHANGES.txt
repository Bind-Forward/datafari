                      Datafari Release Notes

Introduction
------------
Datafari is the perfect product for anyone who needs to search within its corporate big data,
based on the most advanced open source technologies.
Datafari combines both the Apache ManifoldCF and Solr products, and proposes to its users to search into file shares,
cloud shares (dropbox, google drive), databases, but also emails and many more sources. 
Available as community and enterprise edition, Datafari is different from the competition : 
- Its open source license is not aggressive, as it uses the Apache v2 license: you are free to do whatever you want with it,
you just need to mention that you are using it. 
- It combines two renowned Apache projects, namely ManifoldCF and Solr, which gives Datafari a long term vision.

See http://wiki.datafari.com for more information.


Remark
------
Datafari needs Python v 2.7.x. If you have only Python v3, please install Python2 (for Ubuntu 16.04 for example, install the package python-minimal)

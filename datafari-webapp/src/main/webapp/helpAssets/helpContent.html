<h1>Datafari Help</h1>
<h2>Basic Search</h2>
<p>
    Basic search allow you to specify a stgring that will be search in the title, path 
    and content of the indexed documents. Words specified in the query will be search 
    individually (not necessarilly all together or as a phrase). This is done through 
    the search bar that is found on the home page and search page of Datafari.
</p>
<p> 
    An autocompletion mechanism will suggest you terms available in the index
    an starting with the letters you already typed to help you complete you query.
</p>
<p> 
    This basic search supports the usage of boolean operators such as AND or OR to 
    craft more refined queries. More on that later in this help page.
</p>
<p> 
    When you typed something incorrectly, or a search has very few results, a
    suggestion will be proposed to you on the results page to obtain more resutls.
</p>

<h2>Advanced Search</h2>
<p> 
    Advanced search allows you to specify in which the parts of the document you want 
    to search the terms. You can add more criteria by pressing the "+" button at the 
    bottom of the advanced search page. Among the available options, the most notables
    are:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Source:</dt> 
    <dd>
        The source from which the document has been indexed. This is dependent 
        on the configuration that has been used in the indexation jobs.
    </dd>
    <dt>title:</dt> 
    <dd>
        Allow to search in the titles of the documents
    </dd>
    <dt>url:</dt> 
    <dd>
        Allows to search in the path of the files. Might be useful as an aditional 
        criteria when you know the file should be in a particular subtree.
    </dd>
    <dt>content_en / content_fr:</dt> 
    <dd>
        Allows to search in the content of the file, either french or english specifically.
    </dd>
    <dt>Extension :</dt>
    <dd>
        Allows to filter search results to a specific extension (doc, pdf, msg, ...).
    </dd>
    <dt>File size :</dt> 
    <dd>Allows to specify an interval for the size of the files.</dd>
</dl>
<p> 
    Other options exist and you can find them in the "select a field" dropdown in the 
    advanced search. 
</p>

<h2>Using operators :</h2>
<p> 
    You can craft more complex queries using some boolean and unary operators. Bellow is 
    the description of the most common ones :
</p>
<p>
    AND (ou &&): exige que les deux termes autour de l’opérateur soient présents 
    pour que le document fasse partie du résultat.
</p>
<p>
    OR : only one of the terms around the operator is needed for a document to be part 
    of the results. This is the default operator in any search you make. It can thus be
    ommited. "Solar enery" is the same as "solar AND energy" for exemple.
</p>
<p>
    NOT (or -): the term following this operator must NOT be present in the document 
    for the document to be part of the results.
</p>
<p>   
    +: the term following this operator MUST be part of the document for the document 
    to be part of the results.
</p>
<p>    
    Examples and more operators are presented here: <br/>

</p>

<h2>Facets:</h2>
<p>
    On the left of the results page, you have a set of filter options called facets.
    When you click on one of the options, the results is automatically refreshed to 
    match your selection, applying a filter to the current search.
</p>
<p>
    For example, when clicking the "doc" checkbox in the "extension" facet, only .doc 
    documents are shown in the results. This allows you to refine your search and get 
    more relevant results.

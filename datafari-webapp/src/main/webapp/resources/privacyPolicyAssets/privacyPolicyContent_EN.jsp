<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
    DATAFARI is a search engine allowing content management (exploration, indexations and search
    on the content). User profiles are not analysed nor processed. They are used to provide a better
    user experience by removing the need to redefine any preference at each new connection to the
    tool. By default, each user is able to control the data about his account: he can access and
    modify his account preferences through a personal interface. Log data are kept for a period
    defined by your organization for security reasons and are accessible only to the people
    responsible for that security.</p>

    For any question related to your rights to access, modify or delete your personal data, you can
    contact you organization GDPR correspondant at the following address: <a href="mailto:"></a>
